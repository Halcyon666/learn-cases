=== all decorations can be used in abstract class

public String address;
@SuppressWarnings("all")
protected String name;
String phone;
private String postcode;

and can see all the fields in the abstract class.

you can down-casting the abstract class to the abstract class, and then use.

but the generic method is better, you can directly use the concrete class without down-casting, and if define in the class level, you can define the type of the concrete class.

but the generic method is more complicated.
