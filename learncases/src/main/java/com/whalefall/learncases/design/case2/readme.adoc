== display abstract usage

all decorations can be used in abstract class
[source, java]
----
public String address;
@SuppressWarnings("all")
protected String name;
String phone;
private String postcode;
----

and can see all the fields in the abstract class.

you can down-casting the abstract class to the abstract class, and then use.

but the generic method is better, you can directly use the concrete class without down-casting, and if define in the class level, you can define the type of the concrete class.

but the generic method is more complicated.
